Git Setup Instructions for Paleo Recipes
========================================

It appears Git is not installed on your system. To publish your app to GitHub, you'll need to install Git first.

1. Download and Install Git:
   - Visit https://git-scm.com/downloads
   - Download the Windows version
   - Run the installer with default settings

2. After installing Git, open a new Command Prompt or PowerShell window and navigate to your project directory:
   cd C:\Users\leoja\AndroidStudioProjects\PaleobyLeoRecipes

3. Initialize the Git repository:
   git init

4. Add all files to the repository:
   git add .

5. Make the initial commit:
   git commit -m "Initial commit: Paleo Recipes v1.0.0"

6. Create a new repository on GitHub:
   - Go to https://github.com/new
   - Name your repository (e.g., "PaleoRecipes")
   - Don't initialize with a README
   - Click "Create repository"

7. Add the remote origin and push:
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/PaleoRecipes.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main

Your app is now ready for production and GitHub publishing! Once you've installed Git and followed these steps, your repository will be ready for collaboration and distribution.
